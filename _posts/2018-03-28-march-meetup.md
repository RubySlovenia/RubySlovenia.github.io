This time we were greeted by a special guest: [Stefan Kanev], the CTO at [1Tap Receipts]. He delighted us with not only one, but two talks, both of them packed with invaluable knowledge that could only be acquired by many years of working with software.

The first talk was about GraphQL. Stefan described its pros and the cons, when to use it and when to not use it, making a
perfect summary for developers who have been wondering about this exciting piece of technology.

His second talk had its focus in unveiling the wisdom of automated testing. He explained his opinions on how to structure tests and the testing suite, and argumented them well.

Once again, thanks to [1Tap Receipts] for üçª and [Poligon] for üè¢.

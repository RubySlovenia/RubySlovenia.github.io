On 25. november we met again in Poligon. We had two great talks and also some time open to lightning talks.

The first one was from [Miha Rekar](https://twitter.com/mr_foto). He talked about his trip to Israel and [RailsIsrael](https://railsisrael2016.events.co.il/) conference.

The second talk was from [Matic Jurglič](https://twitter.com/matixmatix). He made a short introduction to ActionCable - Websockets in Rails, and how he used it in his latest project - Github Radar.

Last but not least, we also had a lightning talk from [Miha Filej](https://twitter.com/mfilej). He talked about profiling Ruby applications with [ruby-prof](https://github.com/ruby-prof/ruby-prof).

Like always, we had lots of discussions after the talks over beer which was kindly provided by Toptal.

Thanks everyone who came and thanks again to our sponsors - [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com) and [Poligon](http://www.poligon.si) who make events like this possible.

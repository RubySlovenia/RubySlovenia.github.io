On 25. november we met again in Poligon. We had two great talks and also some time open to lightning talks.

The first one was from [Miha Rekar](https://twitter.com/mr_foto). He talked about his trip to Israel and RailsIsrael conference.

The second talk was from [Matic Jurglič](https://twitter.com/matixmatix). He made a short introduction to ActionCable - Websockets in Rails, and how he used it in his latest project - Github Radar. You can find his slides [here](https://speakerdeck.com/matixmatix/websockets-in-rails-actioncable).

Last but not least, we also had a lightning talk from [Miha Filej](https://twitter.com/mfilej). He talked about profiling Ruby applications with RubyProf.

Like always, we had lots of discussions after the talks over beer which was kindly provided by Toptal.

Thanks everyone who came and thanks again to our sponsors - [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com) and [Poligon](http://www.poligon.si) who make events like this possible.

Past weekend was dedicated to [Rails Girls][rails-girls] initiative. Social / hacking event for girls that want to learn programming with Ruby and Rails.

Couple of friendly hackers from [Slovenia RUG][rug] joined as mentors and helped by sharing knowledge and skills - making girls feel welcome and happy.

This was the second time that girls have assembled under [RailsGirls.si][rgl] Ljubljana, and **more then 50 girls participated**.

To find more about what girls are doing please follow them on [@RailsGirls_LJ](https://twitter.com/RailsGirls_LJ) or visit their [Facebook][rgl-fb] / [home][rgl] page.

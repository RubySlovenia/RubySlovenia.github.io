New month, new meetup. We of course met in [Poligon](http://www.poligon.si/) again, because they're just the best.

Speaking of the best - we had a doctor presenting this time! The one and only @sedovsek came to present * Amazing Things on Web*.

He tested our frontend knowledge and demonstrated some crazy CSS hacks. He also presented the amazing storytelling framework [Turtl](http://turtl.co/) which he helps build.

It was great, but don't fret if you missed it. We have [slides right here](http://galjot.si/talks/amazing-things-on-web/).

As per tradition, after the talk we had lots of discussions. Of course you can talk long with dry mouth which is why [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) was there to cover our drinks.

Thanks everyone who came and thanks again to our sponsors - [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com) and [Poligon](http://www.poligon.si) who make events like this possible.

As always make sure you bookmark our meetup page so you won’t miss our [next event](http://www.meetup.com/RubySlovenia/). And if you feel like chatting you’re welcome to join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rubyslovenia/shared_invite/zt-2sedgruvo-gT0KbZbJegW~rK3Jmln~Lg).

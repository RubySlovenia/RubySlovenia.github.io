In a festive conclusion to the year, Ruby enthusiasts came together once again in Ljubljana for the December edition of our meetup at the [Slovenian Computer History Museum].

[Jan Berdajs] kicked off the evening by delving into [Dokku], an impressively simple self-hosted open-source alternative to Heroku. In his presentation, he showcased its capabilities through the lens of his online store, [3dragons]. Jan provided a comprehensive walkthrough, guiding the audience from the initial setup to the final deployment. Dokku emerged as a compelling option for those eager to liberate themselves from the shackles of major cloud providers, save a buck, or have more control over their infrastructure.

Following Jan, [Oto Brglez] delivered a highly provocative talk titled "Beyond Ruby", showing how all our lives' (computational) problems can be solved one monad at a time. Oto demonstrated how Ruby's fundamental building blocks, such as `Array`, `map`, and `flat_map` are actually monads in disguise and how they can be utilized to build powerful computations. He argued his case by slowly evolving a simple sequential API consumer application into highly concurrent beast. Tensions rose as he drew comparisons to [Scala], a functional programming language and broached sensitive topics like type-safety and the infamous Global Interpreter Lock.

We want to express our appreciation to [SciNote] for sponsoring this meetup and for their continued support of our Ruby community. Additionally, a special thank you to [Krištof Črnivec], for organizing and coordinating the event.

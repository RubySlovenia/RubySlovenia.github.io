February's meetup was slightly different than usual. There was a single presentation by [Darko Bodnaruk](https://twitter.com/darkobodnaruk), CTO at [Mediately](https://mediately.co/). He talked about React Native - a hot topic which attracted folks from outside the Ruby developers group. It was a great opportunity to say "Hi!" to friends working with other languages than Ruby.

After the presentation it almost felt like many of the attendees went home to immediately put their hands on React Native. Some of us stayed and discussed things heard during the presentation over a free beer - courtesy of Toptal.

All in all it was another great event. Thanks everyone for coming and thanks to our sponsors - [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com), [V Å½ivo](http://www.vzivo.si/) and [Poligon](http://www.poligon.si/) - who make events like this possible.

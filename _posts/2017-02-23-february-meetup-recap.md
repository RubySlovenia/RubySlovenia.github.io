Hi!

It was somehow delegated to me to make a recap of this meetup for people who couldn't attend? Here it is :)

In this meetup [Domen Ko≈æar][Domen] explained that [ELM] an functional language which compiles to JavaScript. ELM transcompiler guarantees that we won't have any runtime JavaScript errors.

[Domen] went through this guide [guide.elm-lang.org](https://guide.elm-lang.org/), explained what certain parts of this language mean and answered bunch of questions.

At the end of meetup he refered us the following next steps / reading material

- [ELM architecture](https://github.com/evancz/elm-architecture-tutorial)
- [ELM test](https://github.com/elm-community/elm-test)
- [ELM Developers Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/elm-dev)
- [ELM Blog](http://elm-lang.org/blog)
- [ELM UI](http://elm-ui.info/)
- [ELM Material Design Lite CSS/JS library](https://github.com/debois/elm-mdl)
- [Packages for ELM](http://package.elm-lang.org/)

An another choice for generating JavaScript code is [PureScript], but it's more suitable for people who are familiar with functional languages like [Haskell].

After Domen; stage was set for [Arto][artto] and his lovely introduction to recent changes to Ruby 2.4. With cats and nice font!

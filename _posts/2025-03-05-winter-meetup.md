With a glimpse of spring in the air, Ruby enthusiasts came together for another evening of knowledge sharing and community building at [Slovenian Computer History Museum].

The first talk of the evening was by [Damjan Rems], who presented "Agile Building of Intranet Applications With Ruby on Rails". Damjan showcased a very productive framework he developed that is currently in use at the Chamber of Craft and Small Business of Slovenia. Through engaging demos, he illustrated how quickly one can create various forms and data flows for internal organizational needs.

The second presentation was by [Martin Artnik], who offered a thought-provoking perspective on "AI assisted development". Martin highlighted the potential dangers of uncritically incorporating AI-generated code into projects. He warned that this can lead to misunderstandings, suboptimal architectures, and code bloat. While acknowledging that AI tools are impressive and useful, Martin emphasized that developers should remain vigilant and maintain control over their codebases, using AI as a tool rather than a replacement for thoughtful development practices.

Both talks sparked lively discussions, with attendees sharing their own experiences with agile development methodologies and AI tools in their workflows.

As always, we extend our heartfelt thanks to the organizer [Krištof Črnivec] for putting together yet another meetup.

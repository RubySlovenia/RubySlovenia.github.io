Another month, another meetup. We had a blast and thanks to [@vzivo_si](http://www.vzivo.si/), everything was recorded.

First up was [Miha Mencin](https://twitter.com/miha_mencin) with **Fine Tuning the Elastic Search with Evolution Algorithm**:

Next up was [yours truly](https://twitter.com/mr_foto). I talked about [Twofishes](http://twofishes.net/), and how I optimised our code talking to it by using [Thrift](https://thrift.apache.org/).

After that we had two lightning talks. [Jan Berdajs](https://twitter.com/mrbrdo) had a fun one about a hidden `git` feature `git-new-workdir`. He also showed how he made [theine](https://github.com/mrbrdo/theine) - a spring/zeus/spork-like Rails application preloader for jruby:

Last talk of the day was by [Martin Artnik](https://twitter.com/artto) who talked about unsafe defaults in gems which could **delete your entire project**. Not kidding, take a look:

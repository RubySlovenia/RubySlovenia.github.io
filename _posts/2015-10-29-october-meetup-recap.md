On Thursday, October 29, another of our monthly Ruby gatherings took place at [Poligon](http://www.poligon.si/). Yet again we were lucky to get a chance to listen to two truly great talks. If hanging out with Ruby friends isn’t one of the finer things in life, then I don’t know what is.

One of the pioneers of Slovenian Ruby ecosystem, [David Krmpotić](https://twitter.com/bitcells), didn’t come to speak about Ruby. Instead, he presented us with stuff the future is made of and how we’re able to use in the present. His talk was about next-generation JavaScript, called [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features). With informative slides and live coding examples he has shown us the ways and wonderful features that will make writing JavaScript a lot saner - and how to start using it now, with [Babel](https://babeljs.io/). His conclusion was that JavaScript, after all, will probably become a serious language. Prepare yourself to never ever write `var self = this;` again.

Second presenter, [Ivan Nemytchenko](http://nemytchenko.ru/), had the urge to travel all the way from Serbia to tell us to stop being a Rails developer. At first we were shocked, then we agreed! His intriguing talk was about how a developer needs to think outside the “Rails way” box as the complexity of an application grows. He pointed out a few valuable design patterns and techniques, such as using Form Objects, Repository and DDD principles, and a couple of other things that we could use to replace some of Rails’s standard ways and conventions when trying to tame the beastly complexity of a heavy app. Also, make sure not to miss brilliant graphics [on his slides](https://www.slideshare.net/secret/4k5WrmRcpnfiQ5).

See you next time!

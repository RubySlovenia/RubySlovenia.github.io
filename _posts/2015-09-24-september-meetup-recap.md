It's been awhile since our last meetup and after a busy summer we gathered again to meet and greet our old and new Ruby friends. :tada:

This time we had a great opportunity to hear thoughts and first-hand experience on how it's like to be a full-time freelancer and how this work arrangement affects a freelancer's life in various aspects. Our guest speaker from Croatia [Ivo Gregurec](http://ivo.sinmc.org/) has vividly presented how he lives and works as a freelancer, what hardships he encountered along the way, why the scale tips in favor of freelancing for him, while explaining the idea of [Toptal](http://www.toptal.com) and how it enables him to find work and get paid without a hassle.

The second presenter [Srđan Prodanović](http://some1else.flavors.me/) delivered a great talk on how to ease the gap between development and operations with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). We probably all heard about Docker before and had at least a vague idea of what it is, but [Srđan](http://some1else.flavors.me/) made sure we all get what Docker is all about by guiding us hands-on through practical examples.

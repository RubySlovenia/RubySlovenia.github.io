Yet again, two amazing talks unfolded right in front of our eyes in [Poligon](http://www.poligon.si/).

The [first one](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1LVSgfWiceIqAMiC0qTpaxc2sEkBkxwtT5zx6C8k35ss/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=60000) was about [Rack](http://rack.github.io/). [Kri≈°tof ƒårnivec](https://www.facebook.com/kristof.crnivec) reminded us about this essential gem, emphasizing how it powers the most of Ruby web servers in the wild. He showed us some examples of its clear and well-thought-out interface.  

Second talk was delivered by [Roman Oraƒç](https://github.com/romanorac). The main topic was about machine learning, and how they're applying it at [1Tap Receipts](http://1tapreceipts.com/) to categorize photographs of receipts. Some real next-level stuff was revealed here, followed by an intensive Q&A session, which confirmed the interest for machine learning being at an all time high.

We are thankful for [Toptal](https://www.toptal.com/) providing us üçª and for [1Tap Receipts](http://1tapreceipts.com/) bringing us üçï.

We were delighted to welcome a full house of Ruby developers and friends, this time at [agiledrop], who hosted us and provided a great space for our meetup, with refreshing drinks and snacks.

This meetup was special since it was the longest we could remember, running for more than 2 hours of exciting talks.

The first talk was by [Ljubomir Marković], who had a presentation about event sourcing. He presented this software pattern, and how it can be used to build more robust and scalable applications. We heard about his experience with event sourcing in production, together with various tips on how to get started with this pattern.
The crowd was very engaged and asked many interesting questions, and the talk was followed by a lively discussion.

Next up was [Miha Rekar], who presented Turbo, which enables developers to build Rails applications whose behaviour and speed of interaction resemble single-page applications built with JavaScript, without actually writing any JavaScript. This talk also received a lot of attention and questions.

We also had the following lightning talks:

- [Miha Rekar] talked about [Kamal 2], a tool for shipping Rails applications,
- [Domen Kožar] presented [devenv], which is a fast, declarative, reproducible and composable developer environments using Nix,
- [Miha Filej] demonstrated a couple of ideas of how to start a [habit of regular writing](https://writinghabit.com/) in order to clear your mind and improve your skills.

As always, we extend our heartfelt thanks to the organizer [Krištof Črnivec] for putting together yet another fantastic meetup and to [agiledrop] for sponsoring the event.

The enthusiasm and engagement of our members continue to inspire us, and we can't wait to see what insights and connections our next meetup will bring.
